Assingment 1 Problem 2:
Note: every iteration through the list uses equals() in the loop, therefore it is being tested on every output

Testing begin() and next() to iterate through the list
postition_begin = 1
postition_begin = 2
postition_begin = 3
postition_begin = 4
postition_begin = 5
postition_begin = 6

Testing end() and previous() to iterate through the list
End of the List
position_end = 6
position_end = 5
position_end = 4
position_end = 3
position_end = 2

Testing the insert() on the begining, middle and end of the linked list:
postition_begin = 99
postition_begin = 1
postition_begin = 2
postition_begin = 3
postition_begin = 99
postition_begin = 4
postition_begin = 5
postition_begin = 6
postition_begin = 99

Test the delete_node function by deleteing the nodes that were inserted:
postition_begin = 1
postition_begin = 2
postition_begin = 3
postition_begin = 99
postition_begin = 4
postition_begin = 5
postition_begin = 6
